# Relativistic  toolkit

Code to run shooting method using odeint to find scalarization of neutron stars in scalar  tensor gravities.

Python is used to for data processing and also can control the process run.

DISCLAIMER: Integrator_odeint, myFunc_NRnrutil, Solver_newt contains code which is part of Numerical Recepies 

to run:
make run

to clean:
